    <h1>Main Idea</h1>
    <p>This site is mainly going to be a place for me to put projects and ideas that I am working on as well as act as a portfolio for potential jobs in the future. In addtion the header will have a banner for it. I'll resize later</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This area is mainly going to function as an about me, explaining the site and what is going on as well as what I'm doing. Just a standard explanation. I'd probably include pictures of projects that I've done that I like or are more popular.</p>
    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>This is going to be a simple section that has a series of input boxes that allow for a user to send an email in as a get in touch for various reasons</p>
    <h2>Socials</h2>
    <p>Basically just a link to  various other places I'm on and things I'm doing. This is probably just in the footer. Note the imgs are like 20kb already so I'll just resize them with css</p>
